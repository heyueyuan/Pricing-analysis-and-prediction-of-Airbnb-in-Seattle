    "A more elegant method of extracting data from input text is regular espressions.  According to wikipedia, a [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern.  The Unix grep program was one of the first widely used programs that used regular expressions.  In his book Mastering Regular Expressions, Jeffery Friedl says that the Unix grep program's origins come from an early text editor called \"ed\".  The ed text editor had a \"global regular expression print\" function that was capable of searching through lines in the text file using regular expressions.  It turns out that the global regular expression print function was so useful and popular, it we ported from the ed text editor into the unix program called grep.  The ed text editor died a long time ago but grep lives on to this day."

For example, if you understand python regular expressions then you will understand Unix grep; notwithstanding, the syntax will be a little different between the two programs.\n",

The first number in the curly braces specifies the minimum number of expected matches, and the 2nd number in the curly braces specifies the maximum number of expected matches.
